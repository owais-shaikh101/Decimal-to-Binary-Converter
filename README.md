# Decimal to Binary Converter

A simple web-based tool for converting decimal numbers into binary representations. This project demonstrates the process of converting a decimal number to its binary equivalent, providing a visual explanation of the call stack during the conversion process.

## Features

- **Interactive Decimal to Binary Conversion**: Enter a decimal number and instantly see its binary representation.
- **Call Stack Animation**: Visualize how the recursive function works with a dynamic call stack animation that illustrates each step of the decimal-to-binary conversion.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that adjusts to various screen sizes for a seamless user experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **User Input Validation**: Ensures the input is a valid decimal number, with feedback for invalid entries.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: Enter a decimal number into the input field.
2. **Convert**: Click the "Convert" button or press Enter to begin the conversion process.
3. **Call Stack Animation**: If the input is 5, a detailed animation is shown, illustrating the call stack and each recursive call.
4. **Binary Output**: The binary equivalent of the decimal number is displayed on the page.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure and layout of the page.
- **CSS**: For styling the interface and ensuring responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Handles user input, converts decimal to binary, and manages the call stack animation.
